## About Project
**Understanding the circuit and its components:**

*Component 1: The IR Proximity Sensors*

The concept of working of a line follower robot is based on the phenomenon of light. We know that white colour reflects almost all of the light that falls on it, whereas black colour absorbs most of the light. In case of a line follower robot we use IR transmitters and receivers also called photodiodes. They are used for sending and receiving light. IR transmits infrared lights. When infrared rays falls on white surface, itâ€™s reflected back and catched by photodiodes which generates some voltage changes. When IR light falls on a black surface, light is absorb by the black surface and no rays are reflected back, thus photo diode does not receive any light or rays.

Here in this Arduino line follower robot when sensor senses white surface then Arduino gets 1, ie, HIGH as input and when senses black line arduino gets 0, ie, LOW as input.

Circuit connections for IR Proximity Sensors:

    The IR sensor is a 3 three wired sensor, in which the brown and the black wire are used to connect the sensor to the power supply, whereas, the red wire is connected to the load, or Arduino, in our circuit.

    The load wires of the IR sensors are connected to pin 8, 9 and 10 as shown in the schematic.
*Component 2 :L293D motor driver*
